# asteroids_game
# Started up my pygame project for astroids

# Had some issues with the virtual environment and python tracking modules but fixed those.
# Had an issue with the github repo being de-syncs from my local repo. Fixed this by de-tracking those files and updating my .gitignore file to make sure something was deleted or changed that shouldnt be.
# Pull and rebased the github repo onto my local repo and used the commits for those changes to save the files.
