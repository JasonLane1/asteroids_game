# asteroids_game
# Started up my pygame project for astroids

# Had some issues with the virtual environment and python tracking modules but fixed those.
# Had an issue with the github repo being de-syncs from my local repo. Fixed this by de-tracking those files and updating my .gitignore file to make sure something was deleted or changed that shouldnt be.
# Pull and rebased the github repo onto my local repo and used the commits for those changes to save the files.
# I then pushed back to github with the saved changes and it worked. Removing venv/ from the directory and adding them to both the .gitignore file as well as now being untracked by git.

# Created and init the pygame 3 stage game loop - Was a bit confused how this worked to start with but have a pretty good idea now.
# Fill the screen (surface) black and flip to update. Havent added fps limit yet will do next.
