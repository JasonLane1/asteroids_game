# Asteroids_game
### Started up my pygame project for astroids

- Had some issues with the virtual environment and python tracking modules but fixed those.
- Had an issue with the github repo being de-syncs from my local repo. Fixed this by de-tracking those files and updating my .gitignore file to make sure something was deleted or changed that shouldnt be.
- Pull and rebased the github repo onto my local repo and used the commits for those changes to save the files.
- I then pushed back to github with the saved changes and it worked. Removing venv/ from the directory and adding them to both the .gitignore file as well as now being untracked by git.

- Created and init the pygame 3 stage game loop - Was a bit confused how this worked to start with but have a pretty good idea now.
- Fill the screen (surface) black and flip to update. Havent added fps limit yet will do next.

- Been going at the assignment everyday but getting really confused with a lot of the steps.
- A lot of whats being done in the assignment is being handled by pygame and we're just copying a lot of code to make things work. Its been really confusing using this even though I have the documentation its hard to piece all the pieces together Ive never seen work before.
