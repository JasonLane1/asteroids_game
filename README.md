# Asteroids_game
### Started up my pygame project for astroids

- Had some issues with the virtual environment and python tracking modules but fixed those.
- Had an issue with the github repo being de-syncs from my local repo. Fixed this by de-tracking those files and updating my .gitignore file to make sure something was deleted or changed that shouldnt be.
- Pull and rebased the github repo onto my local repo and used the commits for those changes to save the files.
- I then pushed back to github with the saved changes and it worked. Removing venv/ from the directory and adding them to both the .gitignore file as well as now being untracked by git.

- Created and init the pygame 3 stage game loop - Was a bit confused how this worked to start with but have a pretty good idea now.
- Fill the screen (surface) black and flip to update. Havent added fps limit yet will do next.

- Been going at the assignment everyday but getting really confused with a lot of the steps.
- A lot of whats being done in the assignment is being handled by pygame and we're just copying a lot of code to make things work. Its been really confusing using this even though I have the documentation its hard to piece all the pieces together Ive never seen work before.
- Im trying to study the syntax and library to understand what Im doing but its taking a lot of time to debug and truely figure out what everything is doing. Not a fan of this one tbh. Very hand holdy and does most of the work for you with minimal explanation.
- Will work on just focusing on the classes, the structure and the importing from each file to the next while working inside a venv so that I bring something away from this course.

- Completing the astroids project felt pretty empty, I didnt learn a whole lot about classes or pygame either mostly about using multiple files and virtual environments.
- OOP when heavily nested still isn't clicking for me so I will be practicing it on the side to help.
- Moving onto functional programming that is already clicking a lot easier for me. Will see if theres ways to connect the two so I can cross over some skills from one to the other making it easier to understand.
